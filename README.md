# PY-CL-PythonSQLConnection

## Overview
This Python project establishes a Connection to a SQLite Database.

## Files

### lab.py
The lab.py file contains the connect_to_database function, which must be fully and correctly implemented to complete the lab.

### app.py
The app.py file serves as the main entry point for the project. It runs the connect_to_database function in lab.py, and tests whether a Connection has been established.

### lab_test.py
The lab_test.py file contains unit tests for the the connect_to_database function.

## Project Structure
- src/
  - main/
    - app.py
    - lab.py
  - test/
    - lab_test.py

## Getting Started
 
1. Open the `src/main/app.py` file.
2. Review the code and ensure that the necessary function from `lab.py` is imported.
3. Run the `app.py` file if you'd like, to see what lab.py does before your implementation.
4. Modify the `lab.py` file to complete the challenges and demonstrations.
5. Avoid making changes to the test files (`lab_test.py`).
6. Run the test cases (`lab_test.py`) to verify the correctness of your implementation.

Happy Coding!
